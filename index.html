                    Thomas Malthus believed that population growth would grow exponentialy, while the agricultaral output would only increase arithmetically. In the long run Malthus believed that this could lead to a situation where there would not be produced enough food to feed everbody. The kind of food eaten can also have an impact whether overpopulation growth might become a problem, for example eating meat has a bigger impact on our planet that eating vegetables and fruits.

                    An increase in the number of people alive, is directly related to an increase in demand for food. Population growth thus increases the need to produce more food. To increase the demand for food, the agricultural sector needs more land or the used technologies must become more advanced. Demand for more agricultural land is directly related to deforestation. In the twentieth century, many trees have been cut to create more room for the growing need for food.

                <h3>Overpopulation</h3>
                <p class="extraStory">
                    Thomas Malthus predicted that the exponential population growth would create a situation whereby the human population would outgrow its available resources (e.g. agricultural land). While Thomas Malthus theory on overpopulation is already more than two centuries old, there were still many people in the 1960’s and 1970’s that truly believed that overpopulation would become a real problem. In 1968, for example, a biologist named Paul R. Ehrlich from the Stanford University wrote a book called “The Population Bomb”. Dr. Ehrlich’s opening statement left no room for interpretation: “The battle to feed all of humanity is over.” In “The Population Bomb” it was also forecasted that millions of people around the world would starve to death in the 70s, and that densely populated countries as India were in big trouble. Ehrlich even believed that in the year 2000 England might have stop existing altogether and that “the end” was coming. By “the end,” he meant “an complete breakdown of the capacity of the planet to provide humanity its much needed resources.

                <p class="extraStory">
                    Signs which could indicate whether overpopulation might indeed become a problem might be seen by looking at the current population growth trend, the total amount of food available, the kind of food being eaten, the amount of land available for agricultural land and the rate of deforestation. Other indicators also play a role, but these aren’t included on this website. Obviously it would be problematic when the population growth outgrows the growth in total food production. The kind of food eaten can also have an impact whether overpopulation growth might become a problem, for example eating meat has a bigger impact on our planet that eating vegetables and fruits. Finally because the amount of land available is not unlimited, the growth of agriculture contributes to the deforestation that has been taking place around the world.

                <p class="extraStory">
                    While some historians have stated that Malthus’ prediction might have been an accurate prediction of the future of mankind prior to the Industrial Revolution, most historians now agree with many contemporary economist that technological advances in the agricultural sector and further improvements in hygiene and overall health have ensured that Malthus prediction has yet to be fulfilled. Since 1798, the year in which Malthus made his predictions, the human population has increased sevenfold (from approximately 1 to 7 billion). Malthus simply did not foresaw the massive increase in agricultural yields during the twentieth century.
