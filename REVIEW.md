Tips from Roos Greven and Simon Kemmere
___

index html - add more comments (more general comment)

globe.js - remove multiline comment inside function

main.js - merge functions loaddata() and window.onload

lineGraph.js - remove * for multiline comments, add tabs for indentation

timeslider.js - instead of d3 could have used bootstrap to add a time slider

Other remarks: Could have put the functions to create legends in a separate file
