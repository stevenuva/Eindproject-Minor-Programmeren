# day 3
- Finished design document
- Downloaded 9 datasets (one big csv file)
- Converted csv to json
- Removed utf-8 conversion problem

- Problem, with country names not matching country names json data

## to do next days/weeks:
- Data needs to be seperated again per dataset

- manually change country names world-110m-country-names.tsv
